## Data Types

* ### Primitive
 
  * #### boolean
    * `true` or `false` 
  * #### byte
    * from -128 to 127 
  * #### short
    * from -32768 to 32767
  * #### int
    * from -2147483648 to 2147483647
  * #### long
    * from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
  * #### char
    * from '\u0000' to '\uffff' inclusive, that is, from 0 to 65535.
  * #### float & double
    * The floating-point types are float and double, which are conceptually associated with the 32-bit binary32 and 64-bit binary64 floating-point formats.
    * Float literals must end with the character 'f' or 'F' when are initialized. Ej: `float rate = 0.18f;`.
    * Double literals can be initialized with  the 'd' or 'D' character but is not required; since Java floating points literals are double by default. Ej: `double rate = 0.18;` or `double rate = 0.18d;`.
